# bubbleSort

Here is a description of the Bubble Sort algorithm:
The algorithm starts by comparing the first element of the array with the second element. If the first element is greater than the second, they are swapped. Otherwise, they remain in place.
Then, the algorithm compares the second element with the third element and repeats the swapping process if necessary. This continues until the end of the array.
After a complete pass through the array, the largest element will already be at the end of the array, as it will have "bubbled" into the correct position.
The algorithm then repeats the process, but this time deleting the last element, which is already in the correct position. It continues making full passes through the array until all elements are in the correct position.
With each pass, the algorithm compares and swaps adjacent elements, gradually moving the tallest element to the end of the array and sorting the smallest elements to the beginning.
The algorithm continues until no swaps are required in one complete pass through the array, which indicates that the array is sorted.
